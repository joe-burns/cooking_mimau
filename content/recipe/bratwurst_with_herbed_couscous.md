Makes 4 servings (1 bratwurst and some couscous)

Bratwurst:

* 1 package bratwurst
* 2 oz butter
* 1/3 cup beer
* Buns
* Mustard

Couscous:

* 1 package couscous, herbed
* Box recommended amount of water
* 1 oz butter
* salt and pepper

In a frying pan, melt 2 oz butter over medium heat. Once melted, add bratwurst. Brown on each side until nicely seared, 5-10 minutes on each side. Once they have developed nice color, pour 1/3 cup of beer over the bratwurst and cover. Remove from heat once it has stopped steaming. Cut a bratwurst in half to make sure the center is fully cooked- a tiny bit of pink in the middle is fine, you just don't want bright pink.

While the bratwurst is cooking, heat the box recommended amount of water plus an additional half cup (usually ~2.5 cups) in a sauce pan till boiling. Once boiling, turn off the heat, add the couscous and herb mix and stir once or twice, then cover and let it sit for five minutes. After five minutes, the couscous will have absorbed the water and firmed up. Add the butter and a couple shakes of salt and pepper, and stir to combine, breaking up any chunks. Re-cover and take off heat till bratwurst done.

Serve bratwurst in a bun with mustard, side of couscous and a side salad or some fruit.

Freezing directions: Bratwurst can be frozen, but they may not taste quite as good. Couscous can also be frozen, just make sure to let it cool down a little bit before you put it in the freezer.
