Makes 4-8 servings depending on serving size

* 1 lb beef
* 1 stalk large broccoli
* 1/2 onion
* 1/2 bell pepper
* 2 carrots
* (optional) 1 8oz can water chesnuts

Cube the beef into bite size pieces if you didn't buy strips for stir frying. Cut off the heads of the broccoli into bite size pieces. Cut the onion and bell pepper into similar size pieces. Cut the carrots into stir fry strips.

Stir frying is all about cooking things in order starting with the things that will take the longest and moving up. Heat 2 Tbsp of vegetable oil in a frying pan on the highest heat possible. Once the pan is hot, throw in the onions. Stir constantly, cooking 2 minutes. Add broccoli and carrots, stir fry 2 minutes. Add bell pepper and beef, stir fry until beef is browned. Add recommended amount of sauce from bottle label and let it come to bubbling while stirring to incorporate. Remove from heat and serve over rice.
