Ingredients:

* 1 Flank Steak
* Corn Tortillas

Marinade:

* 5-10 cloves garlic
* Kosher Salt
* 2-3 Limes
* 3 Tbsp Chili Powder
* Olive Oil
* 1.5 Tbsp Cumin Powder
* 1.5 Tbsp Coriander Powder

Toppings:

* Cotija Cheese
* Salsas
* Fried Shallots
* Diced tomatos
* Sliced Avocados

Onion Salsa:

* White Onions
* Cilantro
* Limes

Green Salsa:

* Serrano Peppers
* Cilantro
* Limes
* Garlic
* Dash of salt

Smash the garlic with the flat of a knife. Juice the limes then combine all marinade ingredients in a flat bottomed baking dish and rub the marinade into the flank steak. Cover and refrigerate 8-24 hours turning the steak in the marinade 2-4 times during this period.

About an hour before serving remove the steak from the refrigerator and prepare the salsas. For the onion salsa, dice approximately 2 cups of the white onion. Then chop about 1/2 cup of the cilantro. Combine the diced onion and diced cilantro with approximately 1 tbsp of lime juice.

For the Green salsa, combine 5-10 Serrano peppers with 2-3 cloves of garlic and 1 cup of cilantro and the juice of 1-2 limes and salt to taste in a food processor. Chop with the food processor until semi smooth.

Minutes before serving heat a cast iron pan (ideally large enough to fit the entire flank steak) once hot heat tortillas for approximately 10-20 seconds each side keep the tortillas warm by covering them with a towel.

Turn the heat to high. Dry the flank steak with paper towels. Test the pan by dipping a small drop of water on the pan if it balls up and bounces around the pan is hot enough :D. Place the whole flank steak on the pan and cook for only a few minutes each side it. Remove the steak and allow it to rest for five minutes. After resting slice the steak thinly against the grain.

Assemble tacos as desired!
