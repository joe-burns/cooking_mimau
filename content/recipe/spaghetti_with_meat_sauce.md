Should make 4+ sizable servings

Meat sauce:

* 1/2 onion
* 1 lb ground beef
* 1 bottle of marinara sauce
* olive or vegetable oil
* sprinkling of dried sage (optional)

Spaghetti:

* 1/2 Package spaghetti

Chop half an onion into small pieces. Fill a large pot halfway with water. Put on the stove on high, and bring to a boil.

While waiting for the water, add tbsp of oil to a separate pan, heat over medium-high. Once pan is hot, add onion, reduce to medium heat, and cook while stirring till starting to turn translucent. Move onions to edge of pan, add ground beef to center and break into small pieces. Once broken up, stir and cook everything until all meat is brown. Add bottle of marinara sauce to pan and mix. Bring to a simmer and then reduce to low heat. (Optional) Stir in a sprinkling of dried sage.

Once the water comes to a boil, add half the package of spaghetti at an angle. Gently push the center of the spaghetti as it softens so that it is completely submerged. Cook on high (boiling) for 7 minutes or until spaghetti is al dente (is a little chewy). Get your fork out and try some noodles till they're how you like them.

Once done, strain. If you don't have a strainer, using oven mitts, hold the pan with one hand and the lid with the other while leaving a small gap for water to escape and tip the pan over the sink. If you fuck up you're going to end up putting all your pasta in the sink or burning yourself, so maybe just get a strainer at the grocery store.

Put spaghetti on plate, top with meat sauce. Serve with side salad.

Freezing directions: Never tried freezing spaghetti, might not work so great. The meat sauce can be frozen and reheated without issue.
