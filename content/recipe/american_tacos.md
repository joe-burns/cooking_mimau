* 1 lb ground beef
* 1 box of taco shells
* 1 packet of taco seasoning
* vegetable oil
* sprinkling of dried cilantro (optional)

Chop half an onion into small pieces. Add tbsp of oil to a pan, heat over medium-high. Once pan is hot, add onion, reduce to medium heat, and cook while stirring till starting to turn translucent. Move onions to edge of pan, add ground beef to center and break into small pieces. Once broken up, stir and cook everything until all meat is brown. Add the taco seasoning and appropriate amount of water and stir to mix. (Optional) Sprinkle some dried cilantro on top and mix again. Shred a leaf of lettuce by hand and make some tacos.
