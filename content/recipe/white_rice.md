Makes 2ish cups cooked - Scale this recipe to desired amount of rice

- 1 cup uncooked rice
- 2 cups water (with a splash more)
- Salt
- (optional) 1/2 oz butter

Bring the water to a boil in a sauce pan. Add rice, reduce to a simmer (medium-low heat). Give it a SINGLE GOOD STIR and then cover it. Let cook 15 minutes. Open the pan and using a spoon gently make a gap in the middle of the rice to check for water on the bottom of the pan like so:

If there is still water, let it cook another 3-4 minutes. Once time is up, remove from heat, add some salt and butter (optional). Fluff the rice, incorporating the salt/butter and serve.
