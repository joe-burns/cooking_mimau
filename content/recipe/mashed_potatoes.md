Makes 4 large servings

* 4 Large russet potatoes
* 4 oz butter
* Salt, pepper

Quarter potatoes (cut in half, then cut the halves in half) and add potatoes to a pot filled halfway with cold water. Bring water to a boil and let potatoes cook until fork tender (you can poke them with a fork and it goes in with only a little resistance). Remove from heat and drain the water. Cut the butter into 1 oz patties and add to the potatoes. Add salt and pepper (1 tsp salt 1/2 tsp pepper) and mash with a masher or wooden spoon until desired mashedness.
