Makes 2 ish cups cooked - scale to desired amount

- 1 cup uncooked rice
- 2 cups water
- 2 oz finely diced onion
- 1 oz butter
- salt
- pepper

Melt butter in a sauce pan. Add onions over medium-low heat and sweat until translucent. Add rice to pan, and stir to coat with butter. Cook 1-2 minutes to allow outer layer of rice to caramelize. Add water, bring to a boil. Give a single good stir and then cover. let cook 15 minutes blah blah blah, same as regular rice. Check it and don't fuck up.

You can basically add whatever you want to this to make it better. Some leftover peas? Sure why not. Some cajun seasoning? Hell yeah. A little bit of garlic? Go for it champ. You do what you do to get off to your rice pilaf.
